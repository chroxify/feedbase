<Warning>Docker support is currently still not fully stable. Contributions via pull requests or issues are very welcome and appreciated.</Warning>

## Create a new Supabase project

<Tip> You can also self-host Supabase on your own infrastructure. [Learn more](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting).</Tip>

You'll need a Supabase account to get started. [Sign up](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-in) if you don't have one already.

Once you've signed up, create a new project. You can do this by clicking on the "New Project" button or by following [this link](https://supabase.com/dashboard/new/_).

### Migrate your database

Once you've created a new project, you'll need to migrate your database. You can do this the following ways:

<Accordion title="Using Supafork (Recommended)">
    Click [here](https://supafork.com/new?repository_url=https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase) and follow the instructions to fork the Feedbase repository and migrate your database automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using the Supabase CLI">
    For this method, you'll need to install the Supabase CLI. View the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/supabase/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#install-the-cli).

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Clone the Feedbase repository">
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase.git && cd feedbase
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Login to Supabase">
            ```bash
            supabase login
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Link your project">
            ```bash
            supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
            ```

            You can find your project ID in the URL of your Supabase project dashboard or via runnning `supabase projects list`.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Run the migrations">
            ```bash
            supabase db push
            ```
        </Step>
    </Steps>

    If everything went successful, you should be able to see a populated database in your Supabase dashboard.

</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Manually using the SQL Editor">
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Go to your Project's SQL Editor">
            Click on the SQL tab in your project dashboard or follow [this link](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new).
        </Step>
        <Step title="Run the migrations">
            Copy and paste all the contents of each file in the [`supabase/migrations`](https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase/tree/main/supabase/migrations) folder of the Feedbase repository into the SQL editor and run them.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Verify the migrations">
            If everything went successful, you should be able to see a populated database in your Supabase dashboard.
        </Step>
    </Steps>
</Accordion>

## Prepare your environment variables

Once you've migrated your database, you'll need to prepare all necessary environment variables for the next step. 

You can find a list of all environment variables and where to find them [here](https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase/blob/main/.env.example).

## Installation

1. Clone the Feedbase repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase.git && cd feedbase
```

2. Create a `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update the `.env` file with your environment variables.

4. Either run the pre-built Docker image or build and run the Docker image yourself.
<Accordion title="Run using pre-built Docker image (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Pull the Docker image">
            ```bash
            docker pull chroxify/feedbase
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Run the Docker image">
            <Note>If you don't want to run the container in detached mode, you can remove the `-d` flag.</Note>

            ```bash
            docker run -d --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 chroxify/feedbase
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Verify the installation">
            If everything went successful, you should be able to see a running Feedbase instance by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
        </Step>
    </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build and run the Docker image">
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Build the Docker image">
            ```bash
            docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile -t feedbase .
            ```
        </Step>

        <Step title="Run the Docker image">
            <Note>If you don't want to run the container in detached mode, you can remove the `-d` flag.</Note>

            ```bash
            docker run -d --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 feedbase
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Verify the installation">
            If everything went successful, you should be able to see a running Feedbase instance by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
